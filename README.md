# ⚙️ Sensor Fault Detection Project

### 📘 Overview
In electronics, a **wafer** is a thin slice of semiconductor material (like silicon) used to manufacture **microchips** and **solar cells**.  
During the fabrication process, wafers undergo several steps such as **doping**, **etching**, **ion implantation**, and **photolithography** to build integrated circuits.  

This project focuses on detecting **sensor faults** during the wafer manufacturing process using **Machine Learning models**.  
It helps identify faulty wafers early, improving product quality and reducing manufacturing losses.
